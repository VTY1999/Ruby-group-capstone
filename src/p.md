### Team member #3
- Create a Game class in a separate .rb file.
- Create an Author class with an association to the Item class (in a separate .rb file).
- All Game class properties visible in the diagram should be defined and set up in the constructor method.
- All Author class properties visible in the diagram should be defined and set up in the constructor method.
- Implement methods:
    - add_item method in the Author class
        - should take an instance of the Item class as an input
        - should add the input item to the collection of items
        - should add self as a property of the item object (by using the correct setter from the item object)
    - can_be_archived?() in the Game class
        - should override the method from the parent class
        - should return true if parent's method returns true AND if last_played_at is older than 2 years
        - otherwise, it should return false
- Add unit tests for all implemented methods.
- The following options should be available:
    - List of games
    - List all authors (e.g. 'Stephen King')
    - Add a game
 - All data should be preserved by saving collections in .json files.
 - Create a schema.sql file with tables that will be analogical to the structure of the classes that you created:
    - games table (add all properties and associations from the parent Item class as table columns)
    - authors table
